## Functions that first creates an empty variable (m) , second 
## creates four functions in a list to evaluate if the matrix  has been cached then
## and third in case to be the matrix cached, shows the current MAtrix. In case 
## the Matrix is not evaluated, execute the command solve to generate the MË†-1


## makeCacheMatrix is a function that creates two objects (x and m) which
##are assigned to be evaluated in another environment. X is given by the user and m
## is created to evaluate the existence of the matrix in the parent enviroment.
